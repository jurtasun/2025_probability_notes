(https://www.imperial.ac.uk/early-career-researcher-institute/learning-and-development/courses-by-programme/research-computing-and-data-science/further-hypothesis-testing/)

the topics covered will include basic concepts on probability theory, inference, distributions, and hypothesis testing. 
The aim of these lecture notes course is to provide strong foundations at the mathematical and theoretical level, while providing practical exercises to work on real data.
