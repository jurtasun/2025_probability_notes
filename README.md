This course provides an introduction to the field of probability and statistical inference.
Based on the content of the ECRI courses [...], the topics covered will include basic concepts on probability theory, inference, distributions, and hypothesis testing. 
The aim of these lecture notes course is to provide strong foundations at the mathematical and theoretical level, while providing practical exercises to work on real data.

The course is organized in five chapters, covering the topics listed below. 
All will be followed by a practical session and hands-on coding, both in Python and R. 
No prior experience on statistics or programming is required for the attendance of this course.

The content of the course is currently being edited and revised by `Pressbooks` open-source platform. Meanwhile, please find the available pdf version of the notes `statistics_course.pdf`. For exercises and detailed descriptions, the handwritten version of the work-in-progress chapters can be found at the appendices `statistics_couse_app1.pdf` and `statistics_course_app2.pdf`.
