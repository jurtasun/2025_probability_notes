# We simulate 1,000 samples of size 30 for both dice rolls. Calculate and store the mean for each sample.
# The distribution of these sample means should approximate a normal distribution centered around the true mean.

# Parameters
sample_size = 30 # Size of each sample
# num_samples = 10 # Number of samples for CLT
# num_samples = 100 # Number of samples for CLT
num_samples = 1000 # Number of samples for CLT

# True means for comparison
dice_mean = 3.5 # True mean for a six-sided die

# Dice roll sample means
dice_sample_means = [np.mean(np.random.randint(1, 7, sample_size)) for _ in range(num_samples)]

# Plotting CLT results

# Plot sample mean distribution
